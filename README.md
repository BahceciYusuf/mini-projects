# 🚀 Mini Projects & Assignments

Welcome to my **mini projects and programming assignments** repository!  
This repo is a collection of small coding projects, university assignments, and personal practice codes that I’ve written while improving my programming skills.  

Each project has its **own folder** with source code and a dedicated `README.md` explaining what the project does and how to run it.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **C / C++** → For most university programming assignments  
- **Python** → For scripting and small personal projects  
- **(Optionally add more)** → Java, React, etc. if you expand later

## 🎯 Purpose
This repository serves as:
- 📖 An archive of my **university programming assignments**  
- 💡 A showcase of my **practice projects** while learning new concepts  
- 🧑‍💻 A place to experiment, improve, and track my progress
